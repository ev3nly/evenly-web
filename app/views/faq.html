        What will happen to my Evenly account?
      </h2>
        <p>
          Your account will remain active until <strong>January 15, 2014</strong>, at which point 
          we will be shutting down Evenly. Once Evenly is closed, your information – 
          including card numbers and account details – will be deleted. If you still 
          have an account balance after January 15, we will deposit your funds directly to your bank account. 
          <br>
          <br>
          If you have any questions, please email <a href="mailto:support@evenly.com">support@evenly.com</a>.
        </p>

      <h2>
        What functionality is still available?
      </h2>
        <p>
          You can access your account and deposit any remaining Evenly balances.
          You will no longer be able to download the Evenly app, and we have 
          disabled all new user registrations, and the ability to send and request
          funds.

      <h2>
        Now that I can’t use Evenly, how should I send and receive payments?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We highly recommend Square Cash. With Cash, paying a friend is as easy 
        as sending an email. You can learn more <a href="https://square.com/cash">here</a>.
