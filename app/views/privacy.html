        computer.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, we send a "session cookie" to your computer any time you log 
        in to your Evenly account. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you 
        if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that 
        we don't need to ask you for your password on each page.

      <h4>HOW WE PROTECT & STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
      <p>
        We store and process your personal information using third party servers 
        located in secure data centers in the United States. This information is 
        protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance 
        with applicable US federal and state regulations. We also use computer 
        safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical 
        access controls to our office and files, and we authorize access to 
        personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill 
        their job responsibilities. We make reasonable efforts to ensure security 
        on our systems. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that personal 
        information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach 
        of our administrative, managerial and technical safeguards. Therefore, 
        we urge you to take adequate precautions to protect your personal data 
        as well, including never sharing your Evenly password with anyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Evenly learns of a systems security breach, we may attempt to notify 
        you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. 
        By using the Evenly service, you agree that Evenly may communicate with 
        you electronically. Evenly may post a notice on the Website if a security 
        breach occurs. Evenly may also send you an email to you at the email 
        address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may 
        have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. 
        To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your 
        consent from receiving electronic notice of a security breach) you 
        should notify us.
      </p>

      <h4>HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>

        with a safe, smooth, efficient, fun and customized experience. We may use 
        your personal information to:

        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER EVENLY USERS</h4>
      <p>
        We will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to 
        anyone you have paid or who has paid you through Evenly, except with your 
        express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a 
        subpoena or other legal process.
      </p>

      <h4>HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES</h4>
      <p>
        Evenly does not share your email address or phone number with third 
        parties for promotional or marketing purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may share your personal information with:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by or, in the 
            event of any bankruptcy, a bankruptcy estate). Should such a 
            combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity 
            follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. 
            If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, 
            you will receive prior notice and the opportunity to communicate 
            preferences you may have, if applicable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when 
            we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal 
            procedure, when we need to do so to comply with law we believe in good 
            faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to 
            prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal 
            activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement, or as 
            otherwise required by law.

            as "public" or “friends-only” payments such that other Evenly users 
            can view your payments or when you otherwise request Evenly payments 
            be posted to your social web. You may access our privacy controls to 
            designate that all of your payments default to private as well. When 
            you broadcast information to third-party services, such information 
            is no longer under the control of Evenly and is subject to the terms 
            of use and privacy policies of such third parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Evenly does not send your personal information to third-party social 
            networks unless you have specifically requested or authorized us to 
            do so; Service providers under contract who help with parts of our 
            business operations (for example, fraud prevention, payment processing, 
            or technology services); Our contracts dictate that these service 
            providers only use your information in connection with the services 
            they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
          </li>

            Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.
