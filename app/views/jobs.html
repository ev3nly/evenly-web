        We’re builders, focusing on unsolved problems and formulating solutions 
        through beautiful design and great engineering. 
      </h1>
      <p>
        With Evenly, we’re making everyday payment experiences simple and enjoyable. 
        And in doing so, we’re helping our users better enjoy life’s moments. 
        After all, weekend excursions, brunches, and concerts are more fun when 
        you’re not worrying about money. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone has made a payment – everyone hates the experience. We aim to fix 
        that. And it can’t be done alone. So we’re always looking for new teammates
        who share our passion and ingenuity.

          <h2>Passion</h2>
          <p> 
            Not everyone loves solving these problems, but we do. It drives us everyday. 
            We can’t wait to get out of bed in the morning and code iOS animations, sketch 
            wireframes, and draft user emails. And, most importantly, we use what 
            we build daily; we are Evenly’s most fervent and critical users. 
          </p>

          <h2>Ingenuity</h2>
          <p>
            We’re a small team solving enormous challenges. From the beginning we’ve 
            been pushed to become experts new fields. From marketing
            and branding to design and legal, we’re eager to grow and tackle challenges
            outside our comfort zones.
